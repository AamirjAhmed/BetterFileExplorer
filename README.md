# BetterFileExplorer

This repository contains the code for BetterFileExplorer, a project my friends and I are working on for fun. Our goal is to create a more intuitive and efficient file manager that addresses some of the shortcomings of the default Windows File Explorer.

---

## The Problem
We believe the default Windows File Explorer does a poor job of guiding new computer users and others in managing their files. It lacks intuitive sorting, effective space management, and customization options, which often leads to clutter. A lot of people always complain about storage problems, or the speed of their computers, even with deleted files. We aim to reduce the headache here. 

## The App Idea
### Functionality
BetterFileExplorer is designed to improve the way users manage their files, starting with the "Downloads" folder. The app will:
- Automatically sort files by type after a 7-day grace period (or a customizable time frame).
- Delete non-essential files like installers, temp files, and other space-consuming items that are often overlooked.
- Offer advanced sorting options that categorize files more effectively, making it easier to find and manage them.

### Features
Our goal is to make the free version of BetterFileExplorer significantly better than the default Windows File Explorer by offering:
- Customizable color schemes.
- Adjustable time frames for file management (e.g., when files get deleted or moved).
- Custom icons and folder automation for personalized sorting.
- Additional premium features like enhanced sorting algorithms, more customization options, and automated tasks to keep your storage clean and organized.

### Main Problem We Want to Solve
We aim to create a faster and more efficient way to manage files, helping users keep their storage organized without the hassle of manual cleanup.

## Concerns and Considerations
- **Programming Language:** Which language should we use for optimal performance and cross-platform compatibility?
- **File Sorting:** What criteria should we use to further sort files by type? How detailed should this sorting be?
- **Caching:** How should we handle file caching to ensure fast access without consuming too much memory?
- **UI/UX Design:** What design elements will make the app user-friendly and visually appealing? How can we improve the user experience compared to existing file managers?

We're excited to see where this project takes us and hope it can provide a valuable tool for users looking to improve their file management experience.
