# This is the design markdown of our product

We intend to use Python to design our application. 

# The Python Package will be split up into two main parts:

## The first will contain the front end UI elements of the application

## The second will contain the backend code and functionality split up into multiple files. These will include:
  - a file indexer
  - a file sorter
  -  Settings
  -  Differentiating bash files

### Regarding UI
  - Currently we are looking for a suitable python library to code the UI with. 

### File Indexer:
  - This python file will take the tree outputted from the bash file, and index the path to each file in a data structure **need to decide data structure/temp storage system**
